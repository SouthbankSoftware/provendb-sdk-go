## Getting Started

`import "github.com/SouthbankSoftware/provendb-sdk-go/pkg/anchor"`

There a two clients in this library. One is the client generated by `protoc` which provides direct API functionality,
and the other is a client which provides developer simplicity by adding more convenient functions to communicate with the
anchor service. For these examples, we are using the custom client.

To create a new client, do the following:

```go
client, err := anchor.Connect(WithCredentials("$YOUR_API_TOKEN"))
```
